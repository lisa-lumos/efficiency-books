# Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, by Greg Mckeown
## 1. The Essentialist 
- How many times have you reacted to a request by saying yes without really thinking about it? 
- How many times have you resented committing to do something and wondered, "Why did I sign up for this?" 
- How often do you say yes simply to please? Or to avoid trouble? Or because "yes" had just become your default response?

Essentialist is about pausing constantly to ask, "Am I investing in the right activities?" There are far more activities and opportunities in the world, than we have time and resources to invest in. And although many of them may be good, or even very good, the fact is that most are trivial and few are vital. The way of the Essentialist involves learning to tell the difference - learning to filter through all those options and selecting only those that are truly essential.

By investing in fewer things, we have the satisfying experience of making significant progress in the things that matter most. 

Once an Australian nurse who cared for people in the last twelve weeks of their lives, recorded their most often discussed regrets. At the top of the list: "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."

There is tremendous freedom in learning that we can eliminate the nonessentials, that we are no longer controlled by other people's agendas, and that we get to choose. 

It pays to reflect on how short life really is, and what we want to accomplish in the little time we have left.

Three core truths: 
- "I choose to," 
- "Only a few things really matter," and 
- "I can do anything but not everything.

## 2. CHOOSE: The Invincible Power of Choice 
To become an Essentialist requires a heightened awareness of our ability to choose.

## 3. DISCERN: The Unimportance of Practically Everything 
20 percent of our efforts produce 80 percent of results. You could massively improve the quality of a product, by resolving a tiny fraction of the problems.

Warren Buffet decided early in his career it would be impossible for him to make hundreds of right investment decisions, so he decided that he would invest only in the businesses that he was absolutely sure of, and then bet heavily on them. He owes 90% of his wealth to just ten investments. Sometimes what you don't do is just as important as what you do.

The top software developers are more productive than average software developers not by a factor of 10X or 100X or even 1,000X but by 10,000X. It may be an exaggeration, but it still makes the point that certain efforts produce exponentially better results than others.

We should start scanning our environment for those vital few, and eagerly eliminate the trivial many. 

## 4. TRADE-OFF: Which Problem Do I Want? 
Ignoring the reality of trade-offs is a terrible strategy for organizations. 

To discern what is truly essential, we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make.

## 5. ESCAPE: The Perks of Being Unavailable 
If setting aside a full week seems overwhelming or impossible, there are ways of putting a little Think Week into every day. One practice I've found useful is simply to read something from classic literature (not a blog, or the newspaper, or the latest beach novel) for the first twenty minutes of the day. Not only does this squash my previous tendency to check my e-mail as soon as I wake up, it centers my day. It broadens my perspective and reminds me of themes and ideas that are essential enough to have withstood the test of time. 

Just make sure to select something that was written before our hyperconnected era and yet seems timeless. Such writings can challenge our assumptions about what really matters.

## 6. LOOK: See What Really Matters 
In every set of facts, something essential is hidden. Being a journalist of your own life will force you to stop hyper-focusing on all the minor details, and see the bigger picture.

Essentialists are powerful observers and listeners. Knowing that the reality of trade-offs means they can't possibly pay attention to everything, they listen deliberately for what is not being explicitly stated, they scan to find the essence of the information. 

## 7. PLAY: Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child 
Play has the power to significantly improve everything, from personal health, to relationships, to education, to organizations' ability to innovate.

Play stimulates the parts of the brain involved in both careful, logical reasoning and carefree, unbound exploration. Given that, it should hardly be surprising that key breakthroughs in thinking have taken place in times of play.

What did you do as a child that excited you? How can you re-create that today?

## 8. SLEEP: Protect the Asset 
The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. One of the most common ways people - especially ambitious, successful people - damage this asset is through a lack of sleep.

To any overachievers: If you think you are so tough you can do anything I have a challenge for you. If you really want to do something hard: say no to an opportunity so you can take a nap.

Essentialists choose to do one fewer thing right now, in order to do more tomorrow. Yes, it is a trade-off. But cumulatively, this small trade-off can yield big rewards.

- One hour more of sleep equals several more hours of much higher productivity.
- Sleep is for high performers.
- Sleep is a priority.
- Sleep breeds creativity.
- Sleep enables the highest levels of mental contribution.

In a nutshell, sleep is what allows us to operate at our highest level of contribution, so that we can achieve more, in less time. 

## 9. SELECT: The Power of Extreme Criteria
Put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes, Derek-style. Anything less gets a thumbs down. Or as a leader at Twitter once put it, "If the answer isn't a definite yes, then it should be a no. " 

As you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. 

In your life, the killer question when deciding what activities to eliminate is: If I didn't have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to acquire it?

## 10. CLARIFY: One Decision That Makes a Thousand 
When we are unclear about our real purpose in life, when we don't have a clear sense of our goals/aspirations/values, we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look good in comparison to other people. We overvalue nonessentials like a nicer car or house, or even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter, or the way we look in our Facebook photos. As a result, we neglect activities that are truly essential, like spending time with our loved ones, or nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health.

It takes asking tough questions, making real trade-offs, and exercising serious discipline to cut out the competing priorities that distract us from our true intention.

## 11. DARE: The Power of a Graceful "No"
Either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years.

Productivity in my experience consists of NOT doing anything that helps the work of other people, but to spend all one's time on the work the Good Lord has fitted one to do, and to do well. - Peter Drucker

The point is to say no to the nonessentials so we can say yes to the things that really matter. It is to say no, frequently and gracefully, to everything, but what is truly vital.

Whether it's "I am flattered that you thought of me but I'm afraid I don't have the bandwidth", or "I would very much like to but I'm overcommitted", there are a variety of ways of refusing someone clearly and politely without actually using the word no.

Everyone is selling something - an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion - in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it.

After all, when someone asks for something and doesn't get it, his or her immediate reaction may be annoyance or disappointment or even anger. This downside is clear. The potential upside, however, is less obvious: when the initial annoyance or disappointment or anger wears off, the respect kicks in. When we push back effectively, it shows people that our time is highly valuable. It distinguishes the professional from the amateur.

Being vague is not the same as being graceful, and delaying the eventual "no" will only make it that much harder - and the recipient that much more resentful.

Essentialists don't say no just occasionally. It is a part of their regular repertoire. 

Responses you can put in your "no" repertoire:
1. The awkward pause. When a request comes to you, just pause for a moment. Count to three before delivering your verdict. Or if you get a bit more bold, simply wait for the other person to fill the void.
2. The "no but". And provide an alternative
3. "Let me check my calendar and get back to you." It gave you the time to pause and reflect, and ultimately reply that you are regretfully unavailable. It enable you to take back control of your own decisions, rather than be rushed into a "yes" when asked.
4. Auto reply email
5. "Yes. What should I de-prioritize? ". It reminds your superiors what you would be neglecting, if you said yes and force them to grapple with the trade-off.
6. Say it with humor. A simple: Nope!
7. "You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y." For example, You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you. By this you are also saying, I won't be able to drive you. 
8. "I can't do it, but X might be interested." often people requesting something don't really care if we're the ones who help them, as long as they get the help.

## 12. UNCOMMIT: Win Big by Cutting Your Losses 
Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time/money/energy into something we know is a losing proposition, simply because we have already incurred/sunk a cost that cannot be recouped. This can easily become a vicious cycle: the more we invest, the more determined we become to see it through, and see our investment pay off. The more we invest in something, the harder it is to let go.

An Essentialist has the courage and confidence to admit their mistakes and uncommit, no matter the sunk costs.

Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off. All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today. 

## 13. EDIT: The Invisible Art 
Ultimately, having fewer options actually makes a decision easier on the eye and the brain, we must summon the discipline to get rid of options or activities that may be good, or even really good, but that get in the way. 

An editor is ruthless in the pursuit of making every word count. Instead of saying it in two sentences, can you say it in one? Is it possible to use one word where two are currently being used? 

As Michael Kahn explains, he doesn't always do what Spielberg tells him to do; instead, he does what he thinks Spielberg really wants. Understanding the overarching intent allows him to make the corrections that even Spielberg himself might not be able to verbalize. Having a clear overarching intent enables us to check ourselves, to regularly compare our activities or behaviors to our real intent. If they are incorrect, we can edit them.

Becoming an editor in our lives also includes knowing when to show restraint. One way we can do this is by editing our tendency to step in. When we are added onto an e-mail thread, for example, we can resist our usual temptation to be the first to reply all. When sitting in a meeting, we can resist the urge to add our two cents. We can wait. We can observe. We can see how things develop.

Editing our time and activities continuously allows us to make minor but deliberate adjustments along the way. Becoming an Essentialist means making cutting, condensing, and correcting a natural part of our daily routine - making editing a natural cadence in our lives.

## 14. LIMIT: The Freedom of Setting Boundaries 
Having an understanding up front, about what we are really trying to achieve, and what our boundaries are, keep us from wasting each other's time, saddling each other with burdensome requests, and distracting each other from essential things. 

## 15. BUFFER: The Unfair Advantage 
We can reduce the friction of executing the essential in our work and lives simply by creating a buffer.

The Essentialist looks ahead. They plan. They prepare for different contingencies. They expect the unexpected. They create a buffer to prepare for the unforeseen, thus giving themselves some wiggle room when things come up, as they inevitably do.

## 16. SUBTRACT: Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles

## 17. PROGRESS: The Power of Small Wins 
What if, instead of just focusing on catching criminals - and serving up ever harsher punishments - after they committed the crime, the police devoted significant resources and effort to eliminating criminal behavior before it happens?

Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don't really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential.

To really get essential things done we need to start small and build momentum. Then we can use that momentum to work toward the next win, and the next one and so on until we have a significant breakthrough - and when we do, our progress will have become so frictionless and effortless that the breakthrough will seem like overnight success.

The key is to start small, encourage progress, and celebrate small wins.

Done is better than perfect.

What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to the essential task we are trying to get done?

## 18. FLOW: The Genius of Routine 
The Essentialist designs a routine that makes achieving what you have identified as essential the default position. In some instances an Essentialist still has to work hard, but with the right routine in place each effort yields exponentially greater results.

With repetition the routine is mastered and the activity becomes second nature.

Once the mental work shifts to the basal ganglia, mental space is freed up to concentrate on something new.

Highly creative people use strict routines to free up their minds. Most creative individuals find out early what their best rhythms are for sleeping, eating, and working, and abide by them even when it is tempting to do otherwise. They wear clothes that are comfortable, they interact only with people they find congenial, they do only things they think are important.

Because the CEO has eliminated the mental cost involved in planning the meeting or thinking about who will or won't be there, people can focus on the creative problem solving. And indeed, his team makes coming up with creative, inventive ideas and solutions look natural and easy.

Without being fully aware, we can get caught in nonessential habits. 

## 19. FOCUS: What's Important Now? 
We can't control the future in a literal sense, just the now. Only in the here and now can we actually execute on the things that really matter. 

Nonessentialists tend to be so preoccupied with past successes and failures, as well as future challenges and opportunities, that they miss the present moment. They become distracted. Unfocused. They aren't really there. 

To focus on the things that are truly important - not yesterday or tomorrow, but right now.

Multitasking itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can "multifocus" is.

What was important right now, was to figure out what was important right now. 

Suppose you are drinking a cup of tea. When you hold your cup, you may like to breathe in, to bring your mind back to your body, and you become fully present. And when you are truly there, something else is also there - life, represented by the cup of tea. In that moment you are real, and the cup of tea is real. You are not lost in the past, in the future, in your projects, in your worries. You are free from all of these afflictions. And in that state of being free, you enjoy your tea. That is the moment of happiness, and of peace.

## 20. BE: The Essentialist Life
We can all purge our lives of the nonessential and embrace the way of the Essentialist - in our own ways, and in our own time, and on our own scale. 

Essentialist is something you are, it is your lifestyle. 

These people who make their greatest contribution don't just give lip service to the idea of "less but better". They have deliberately chosen to fully embrace the way of the Essentialist.

Focusing on the essentials is a choice. It is your choice. That in itself is incredibly liberating.

Author's learnings: 
- The first is the exquisitely important role of my family in my life. At the very, very end, everything else will fade into insignificance by comparison. 
- The second is the pathetically tiny amount of time we have left of our lives. I know of someone who visits cemeteries around the world when he travels. I thought this was odd at first, but now I realize that this habit keeps his own mortality front and center.

Whatever decision or challenge or crossroads you face in your life, simply ask yourself, "What is essential?" Eliminate everything else.
